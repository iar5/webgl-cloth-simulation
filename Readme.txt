WebGL Cloth Simulation

The practical part of a university project was about and developing a WebGL-based cloth simulation. The vision was to simulate clothing on personalized body models directly in the browser, for online shops, based on their sewing patterns. The core of the simulation is a mass-spring system utilizing various types of springs, following the approach of Xavier Provot. Additionally, several algorithms were developed to enhance fabric tension and improve the realism of the cloth simulation. It is implemented in pure WebGL and JavaScript.
